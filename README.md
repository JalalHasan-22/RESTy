In this app, we are trying to build a postman clone, making the basic http methods such as get, post, put and delete.

We have a text field where the user can enter the url and select the http method from radio buttons.

below you can check the uml diagram.

## lab-27 Phase 2

In this lab, I've used JSON pretty to get a dummy JSON format data as a place holder instead of mock results.

I also implemented the four http methods, git, post, put and delete, all of the methods has been tested and functioning properly.

## Notes for lab 28

Since I have already implemented the functionality of getting the data from a third party API, I was finished in no time, the only thing that is still to be implemented is the useEffect hook which kept me thinking of how to implement it into this project; I'll try to comeup with something in the following day or two.
